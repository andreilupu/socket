# Admin Options


### Wishful thinking
At the version one this repository will stand as a WordPress framework for plugins options. Pretty much something like Options Framework or Redux, Option tree or whatever is out there in the world.

But the road is long.

## Why in the hell another options framework??
Because I can!

And mainly because I'm thinking to use:
 * React and [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com) as interface 
 * The new WordPress REST API to handle the data
 
Isn't this the next Big thing in web apps and WordPress dashboard management?

Don't believe me? Ask Matt!

## Install and develop

Well, simply `npm install` and you are ready to run

`gulp styles` – to build styles

`gulp compile` – to build from react to ES5

`gulp watch` - if you don't want to bother too much with the terminal
